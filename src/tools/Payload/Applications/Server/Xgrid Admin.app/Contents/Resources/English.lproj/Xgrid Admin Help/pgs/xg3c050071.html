            </div>
            <div class="AppleTopicBody">
               <div class="Intro">
                  <p class="Para">Xgrid creates multiple tasks for each job and distributes those tasks among multiple nodes. These nodes can be desktop computers
                     running Mac OS X v10.3 or later, or server computers running Mac OS X Server v10.4 or later.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">Many desktop computers sit idle during the day, in evenings, and on weekends. The assembly of these systems into a computational
                     grid is known as <span class="Emphasis">desktop recovery. </span>This method of grid construction enables you to vastly improve your computational capacity without purchasing extra hardware,
                     and Xgrid makes the software configuration a straightforward task.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">For a server to function as a controller, Xgrid requires Mac OS X Server v10.4 with a minimum of 256 MB of RAM or Mac OS X
                     Server v10.5 or later, with 1 GB of RAM. To operate as an agent in a grid, Xgrid requires Mac OS X v10.3 or later with a minimum
                     of 128 MB of RAM (256 MB advisable) or Mac OS X v10.4 or later, with 512 MB or RAM. All Xgrid participants must have a network
                     connection. As always, the more RAM a system has, the better it performs, especially for high-performance computing applications.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">A <span class="Emphasis">grid </span>is a group of computers working together to solve a single problem. The systems in a grid can be loosely coupled, geographically
                     dispersed and, to some extent, heterogeneous. In contrast, systems in a <span class="Emphasis">cluster </span>are often homogeneous, collocated, and strictly managed.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">Highly dispersed grids, such as SETI@Home, enable individuals to donate their spare processor cycles to a cause. In office
                     environments, large rendering or simulation jobs can be distributed across all the systems left idle overnight. These can
                     even be used to augment a dedicated computational cluster, which is available to Xgrid clients at all times.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">Xgrid has no limitations on the amount of computational power it can support. The performance of the grid depends on the systems
                     participating, the software running, and the network, among other factors. However, individual applications strongly influence
                     the performance of the grid.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">You determine if an application is improved by being deployed on a computational grid. In the best case, application performance
                     might scale linearly with the size of the grid. In the worst case, the addition of agents to a grid can cause a job to complete
                     in even more time than if there were fewer agents. (In such a situation, tasks become so small that the overhead associated
                     with distributing the increased number of tasks supersedes the performance gain of using more agents.) You should be aware
                     of these considerations.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">Many proprietary projects enable you to participate in a large computational grid. Often these projects, such as SETI@Home
                     and FightAIDS@Home, are tied to a specific scientific purpose. They usually have easy-to-install software that enables any
                     volunteer to participate in that project, and they frequently take the form of a screen saver or background process.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">You don’t need to think in terms of thousands or millions of seldom-used computers to see the significance of a computational
                     grid. For example, computers used by university students or corporate employees often work fewer hours than the hours they
                     sit idle at night or on weekends. These computers could contribute productively to the work of a grid without diminishing
                     their usefulness to the students or employees.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">Other grid projects are designed for large-scale computational grids, such as the Globus Alliance (a group founded by universities
                     and researchers), with flexible resource management tools and more intelligent grid deployment methods. Instead of developing
                     neatly packaged applications for a specific grid, such projects provide comprehensive frameworks for application deployment.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">Xgrid enables users to participate in a computational grid of their choice while still providing the flexibility of a more
                     generic framework for grid developers when deploying grid applications. Xgrid provides the primary benefits of both.
