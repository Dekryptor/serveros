After 15 seconds (by default) this composition minimizes the screen recording movie, moves it to the right,                                 and displays the second movie in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Finally, after 15 seconds (by default) the composition                                 brings back the screen recording movie into full screen and hides the second movie. This process repeats for the duration                                 of the movie.                              </p>                           </li>                        </ul>                        <ul class="ListBullet">                           <li>                              <p class="Para">Overlay—This picture-in-picture composition displays the screen recording movie in full screen and overlays the second movie                                 in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Then, in response to conditions in the screen recording (for example, a slide doesn’t                                 change for more than 20 seconds) the location of the overlay is switched, if transition detection is enabled. If transition                                 detection is not enabled, both movies remain in their original positions.                              </p>                           </li>                           <li>                              <p class="Para">Overlay with Fade—This composition is similar to the Overlay composition, but instead of keeping the second movie in view                                 all the time, this composition fades the movie in and out at certain intervals (10 seconds by default).                              </p>                           </li>                        </ul>                        <ul class="ListBullet">                           <li>                              <p class="Para">Theater—This composition is similar to the Overlay composition, except that you always have a full view of the screen recording                                 movie.

This is useful when doing a screen recording or for any video that                           includes presentations.                        </p>                        <p class="Para">The tool used by the workflow to add chapter markers detects stability in a movie by comparing frames. When the tool finds                           a stable sequence, it considers it a chapter. Then, when the sequence changes to another sequence, the tool consider that                           change a transition.                        </p>                        <p class="Para">Chapter markers are recommended for screen recordings, but not for video and audio recordings. However, there are instances                           when adding these markers is useful, such as when the source video is for a screen recording captured from the VGA or DVI                           stream of a computer screen. Screen recording using Podcast Capture works only on a computer running Mac OS X v10.5 or later.                        </p>                     </li>                     <li>                        <p class="Para">Click Done.</p>                     </li>                     <li>                        <p class="Para">Choose File &gt; Save.</p>                     </li>                  </ol>               </div>            </div>         </div>      </div>   </body></html>
