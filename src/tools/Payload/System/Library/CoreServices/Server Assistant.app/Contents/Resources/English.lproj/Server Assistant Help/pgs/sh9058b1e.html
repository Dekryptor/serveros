                  <p class="Para">In the AirPort Management pane, you can tell Mac OS X Server to manage an AirPort Extreme Base Station (802.11n) or a Time
                     Capsule so that it protects your local network while allowing access to some services from the Internet. To enable AirPort
                     management:
                  </p>
                  <ul class="ListBullet">
                     <li>
                        <p class="Para">You must enter the base station or Time Capsule password (not the wireless network password).</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p class="Para">If your server can connect to more than AirPort Extreme Base Station or Time Capsule, you need to know the name of the one
                           your server will manage.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="Para">After initial setup, you can use Server Preferences to specify individual services that you want to be accessible from outside
                     your local network. Mac OS X Server will configure your AirPort Extreme Base Station or Time Capsule to allow incoming requests
                     for those services to pass to your server.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">If your server will provide VPN service through your AirPort Extreme Base Station or Time Capsule to users who have their
                     own AirPort Base Station, Time Capsule, or other router configured to share an Internet connection, your server’s IP address
                     can’t begin with the same three numbers as VPN users’ IP addresses, such as 10.0.1 or 192.168.1. For information about avoiding
                     IP address conflicts, see the <span class="Emphasis">Getting Started</span> manual included with Mac OS X Server.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">The AirPort Management pane appears if your server’s primary network interface is connected to the Internet through your AirPort
                     Extreme Base Station or Time Capsule. In addition, your AirPort Extreme Base Station or Time Capsule must have its Connection
                     Sharing option set to “Share a public IP address” (that is, an Internet connection).
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">The AirPort Management pane doesn’t appear during remote setup of multiple servers.</p>
