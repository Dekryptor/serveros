                     <div class="Name">Apple Customer Privacy Policy</div>
                     <p class="Para">Apple’s Customer Privacy Policy covers the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information that may be collected by
                        Apple anytime you interact with Apple, such as when you visit our website, when you purchase Apple products and services,
                        or when you call our sales or support associates. Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information
                        practices, including what type of information is gathered, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose
                        the information, and how we safeguard your personal information. Your privacy is a priority at Apple, and we go to great lengths
                        to protect it.
                        
                     </p>

                  <div class="Subhead">
                     <div class="Name">Why we collect personal information</div>
                     <p class="Para">We collect your personal information because it helps us deliver a superior level of customer service. It enables us to give
                        you convenient access to our products and services and focus on categories of greatest interest to you. In addition, your
                        personal information helps us keep you posted on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, and events
                        that you might like to hear about.
                     </p>
                     <p class="Para">If you do not want Apple to keep you up to date with Apple news, software updates and the latest information on products and
                        services go to www.apple.com/contact/myinfo and update your personal contact information and preferences.

                     <p class="Para">There are a number of situations in which your personal information may help us give you better products. For example:</p>
                     <ul class="ListBullet">
                        <li>
                           <p class="Para">We may ask for your personal information when you’re discussing a service issue on the phone with an associate, downloading
                              a software update, registering for a seminar, participating in an online survey, registering your products, or purchasing
                              a product.
                           </p>

                        <li>
                           <p class="Para">When you interact with Apple, we may collect personal information relevant to the situation, such as your name, mailing address,
                              phone number, email address, and contact preferences; your credit card information and information about the Apple products
                              you own, such as their serial numbers and date of purchase; and information relating to a support or service issue.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p class="Para">We also collect information for market research purposes — such as your occupation and where you use your computer — to gain
                              a better understanding of our customers and thus provide more valuable service.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p class="Para">We collect information regarding customer activities on our websites, MobileMe, and the iTunes Store. This helps us to determine
                              how best to provide useful information to customers and to understand which parts of our websites, products, and Internet
                              services are of most interest to them.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p class="Para">We may use personal information to provide products that you have requested as well as for auditing, research, and analysis
                              to improve Apple’s products.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p class="Para"><span class="EmphasisDisplay">Your Apple ID and related information</span></p>
                     <p class="Para">The Apple website, as well as Apple services such as MobileMe and the iTunes Store, allows you to create an “Apple ID” based
                        on your personal information. This convenient service saves you time and allows for easier use of our web services. Here’s
                        how it works: You create a personal profile — providing your name, phone number, email address, and in some cases your mailing
                        address or a credit card number — and choose a password and password hint (such as the month and day of your birth) for security.
                        The system saves your information and assigns you a personal Apple ID — in many cases simply your email address, because it’s
                        unique and easy to remember. The next time you order from the Apple Store or register a new product, all you need to do is
                        enter your Apple ID and password; the system looks up the information it needs to assist you. In addition, if you update the
                        information associated with your Apple ID it will be available for all your transactions with Apple globally.
                     </p>
                     <p class="Para"><span class="EmphasisDisplay">MobileMe Gallery and gift services</span></p>
                     <p class="Para">Apple also enables you to share photos or movies through MobileMe Gallery, set up allowances on the iTunes Store and purchase
                        and send gift certificates and products, to family members, friends or colleagues. To fulfill your request, Apple may require
                        personal information about the person to whom you are sending the product or service such as their name, physical address,
                        email address, and so on. The personal information you provide about that person is used only for the purpose for which it
                        is collected. Apple will not use the information collected to market directly to that person.
                     </p>
                     <p class="Para"><span class="EmphasisDisplay">Publicly displayed information is public</span></p>
                     <p class="Para">If you use a bulletin board or chat room on an Apple website you should be aware that any information you share is visible
                        to other users. Personally identifiable information you submit to one of these forums can be read, collected, or used by other
                        individuals to send you unsolicited messages. Apple is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose
                        to submit in these forums. For example, if you choose to make information, which was previously non-public, available by enabling
                        certain user features, Apple will collect that information from your interaction and the information will become publicly
                        available.

                     <p class="Para">To help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared with legal entities within the Apple group globally
                        who will take steps to safeguard it in accordance with Apple’s privacy policy.
                     </p>
                     <p class="Para"><span class="EmphasisDisplay">With our service providers, vendors, and strategic partners</span></p>
                     <p class="Para">There are also times when it may be advantageous for Apple to make certain personal information about you available to companies
                        that Apple has a strategic relationship with or that perform work for Apple to provide products and services to you on our
                        behalf. These companies may help us process information, extend credit, fulfill customer orders, deliver products to you,
                        manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service, assess your interest in our products and services, or conduct
                        customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are also obligated to protect your personal information in accordance
                        with Apple’s policies, except if we inform you otherwise at the time of collection. For example, when you purchase and activate
                        your iPhone, you authorize Apple and its carrier to exchange the information that you provide during the activation process
                        to carry out service. If you are approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and its carrier’s respective
                        privacy policies. Without such information being made available, it would be difficult for you to purchase products, have
                        products delivered to you, receive customer service, provide us feedback to improve our products and services, or access certain
                        services, offers, and content on the Apple website.
                     </p>
                     <p class="Para">At times we may be required by law or litigation to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about
                        you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary.

                     <p class="Para">Apple takes precautions—including administrative, technical, and physical measures—to safeguard your personal information
                        against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
                     </p>
                     <p class="Para">The Apple Online Store and iTunes Store use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information
                        is required. To make purchases from the Apple Online Store or iTunes Store, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Safari,
                        Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later, or Internet Explorer. Doing so protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card
                        information while it’s transmitted over the Internet.
                     </p>
                     <p class="Para">You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords
                        often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure web browser like Safari.

                        it is used. Naturally, you always have the right to access and correct the personal information you have provided. You can

                        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 for marketing purposes, but because some information
                        is collected electronically, it can appear to be the personal information of the Apple purchaser of the product, and will
                        be treated as such by this privacy policy. If a child under 13 submits personal information to Apple and we learn that that
                        personal information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.

                        which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. We also
                        use cookies and other technologies to make sure that our online advertising is bringing customers to our products and services,
                        such as iTunes. We use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on our website, to make it even more rewarding
                        as well as to study the effectiveness of our customer communications. And we use cookies to customize your experience and
                        provide greater convenience each time you interact with us.
                     </p>
                     <p class="Para">For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you with a greeting the next time you visit the Apple Store. Information
                        such as your country and language—and if you’re an educator, your school—helps us provide a more useful online shopping experience.
                        And your contact information, product serial numbers, and information about your computer helps us register your products,
                        personalize Mac OS X, and set up your MobileMe service and provide you with customer service.
                     </p>
                     <p class="Para">If, however, you prefer not to enable cookies, please go to www.apple.com/legal/privacy/aboutcookies.html, which explains

                     <p class="Para">As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes
                        Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
                        stamp, and clickstream data.

                     <p class="Para">We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’
                        movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Apple will not use the information
                        collected to market directly to that person.
                     </p>
                     <p class="Para">In some of our email messages we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Apple website. When customers click one
                        of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data
                        to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer
                        not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.
                     </p>
                     <p class="Para">In addition we use pixel tags—tiny graphic images—to tell us what parts of our website customers have visited or to measure
                        the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our site.
                     </p>
                     <p class="Para">Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read. And they tell us whether emails have been
                        opened to ensure that we’re sending only messages that are of interest to our customers. We may use this information to reduce
                        or eliminate messages sent to a customer. We store all of this information in a secure database located in Cupertino, California,
                        in the United States.
