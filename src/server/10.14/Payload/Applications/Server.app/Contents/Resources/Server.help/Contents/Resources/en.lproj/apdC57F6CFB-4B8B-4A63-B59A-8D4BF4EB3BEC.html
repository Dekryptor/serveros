Specify whether users access your server by using its host name only on your intranet or on your intranet and the Internet. You can enter the server’s host name in the next pane.</p><table data-type="Multicolumn" aria-label="Server scope options"><tbody><tr><td><p>Local Network</p></td><td><p>Select this option to let users access your server only from your intranet. Users can access your server by using its local network name, also known as the <em>local hostname</em>. It’s typically the server’s computer name with .local appended.</p><p>Only computers on your local IP subnet can access your server by using its local network name. Usually, computers on the same subnet have IP addresses that begin with the same three numbers—for example, 192.168.1.</p><p>If the server’s host name is its local network name, the server doesn’t support Kerberos or single sign-on authentication.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Domain Name</p></td><td><p>Select this option to let users access your server by using the same host name on the Internet and your intranet.</p><p>The DNS servers you use for the Internet must be configured to use the server’s host name to look up its IP address, and vice versa. This means the DNS server must have a record for forward lookup (an A record) and a record for reverse lookup (a PTR record). Ask your ISP or DNS hosting service to configure these DNS records for you.</p><p>If your intranet has a DNS server, it also must be configured with records for forward lookup and reverse lookup. Ask your intranet DNS server administrator to configure these DNS records for you.</p><p>If your intranet doesn’t have a DNS server, the server setup assistant configures your server to provide minimal DNS service so users can use your server’s host name on your intranet.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="LinkUniversal"><strong>See also</strong><a href="apd0FC9AA8E-84A0-41A4-A9C2-24A4D5F8BBE7.html#apd0FC9AA8E-84A0-41A4-A9C2-24A4D5F8BBE7" class="xRef AppleTopic">Register the server’s Internet host name</a></div></body></html>
