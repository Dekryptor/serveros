                connected to the Internet through your AirPort Extreme Base Station or Time Capsule.
                In addition, your AirPort Extreme Base Station or Time Capsule must have its
                Connection Sharing option set to “Share a public IP address” (that is, an Internet
                connection).</p><p class="p">Use the AirPort Management pane to authorize OS X Server to manage an AirPort device.
                OS X Server can manage an AirPort Extreme Base Station (802.11n) or a Time Capsule. </p><p class="p">To authorize AirPort management, enter the base station or Time Capsule password (not
                the Wi-Fi network password).</p><p class="p">The Server app configures your AirPort device’s DHCP server to reserve your server’s
                IP address, and to always assign that IP address to your server.</p><p class="p">You can use the Server app to designate public
                services that can be accessed by computers on the Internet. OS X Server configures
                your AirPort device to expose those public services on the Internet. The process of
                exposing individual services to the Internet is called “port mapping” or “port
                forwarding.”</p><p class="p">You can also use the Server app to let users log in to your wireless network with
                their user name and password instead of the Wi-Fi network password. In this case,
                your server provides Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) for your
                AirPort device and authorizes all user accounts on the server to access your
                wireless network.</p><p class="p">If you want to expose public services on the Internet through an AirPort device or
                other router, and your server provides VPN service to users who have their own
                AirPort device or other router configured to share an Internet connection, your
                server’s IP address can’t begin with the same three numbers as VPN users’ IP
                addresses, such as 10.0.1 or 192.168.1.</p><p class="p">To manage your AirPort device after installing the Server app, select your AirPort
                device in the sidebar. It will be near the top of the sidebar in the
                Hardware section.</p></div></div></body></html>
