        one active Ethernet network.  <span class="shortdesc">Choose the server’s primary network connection from
        the pop-up menu. </span></div><div class="section"><p class="p">When you click Continue in this pane, the server setup assistant uses the network you
                choose to determine the server’s network identity, including its IP address and host
                name. The server setup assistant tries to obtain the server’s IP address from a DHCP
                server on the network and uses this IP address to obtain the server’s host name from
                a DNS server on the network. If necessary, you can change the server’s network
                configuration and identity in a subsequent pane.</p><p class="p">If you plan to configure an AirPort device as a gateway after finishing server setup,
                choose the interface that connects to your AirPort device (usually Wi-Fi). You can
                later use the Server  app to set up the gateway.</p><div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you’re controlling the server setup assistant from another computer by using
                screen sharing and you change the network service, the screen sharing session might
                end. Try making a screen-sharing connection using the new network service, or go to
                the server and use its keyboard and display to continue setup locally. </div></div></div><div class="related-links"><div class="relinfo"><strong>Related information</strong><br><div><a class="link" href="t_RegisterInternetName.html" title="To allow users to access the server by using its host name on the Internet, you must register the server’s host name.">Register the server’s Internet host name</a></div><div><a class="link" href="#r_DNSrecords">Set DNS for your server</a></div><div><a class="link" href="#r_DHCPforServer">DHCP server configuration for your server</a></div></div></div></body></html>
