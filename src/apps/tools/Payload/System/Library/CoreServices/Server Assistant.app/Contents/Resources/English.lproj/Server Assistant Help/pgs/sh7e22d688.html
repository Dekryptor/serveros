                  <p class="Para">Web services can provide wikis, blogs, web calendars, web access to email, and custom websites.</p>
                  <p class="Para">If web services are on, everyone with a user account on the server gets a convenient wiki portal, called My Page, for viewing
                     and creating wikis and blogs, using web calendars, tracking wiki updates, and accessing webmail. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">All users can easily create wikis and control who can view, search, and edit their wiki content. By using included templates
                     or creating their own, users can add, delete, edit, and format content naturally—without knowing markup codes or special syntax.
                     With a few clicks, or by dragging and dropping, they can attach files and images, publish podcasts, assign keywords, and link
                     to other wiki pages or other websites. They can also review the wiki’s complete history of changes and revert any page to
                     a previous version.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">Web calendars let people keep track of appointments, meetings, and other events using any web browser. Users can send and
                     receive invitations to events. When inviting people to an event, users can see each person’s availability on a timeline. Each
                     user’s My Page portal includes a personal web calendar, and each wiki can also have a calendar that everyone who has access
                     to the wiki can use. Users can create multiple calendars on their personal web calendars and on wiki group calendars that
                     they have access to. Users with Snow Leopard can also use the iCal application to view, change, and create events that appear
                     in web calendars.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">Blogs give nontechnical users a way to keep their colleagues up-to-date with projects, files they’re working on, and pictures
                     or podcasts. Users publish their own blogs with drag-and-drop ease, using a selection of built-in professional templates.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">With webmail, users can receive and send mail from a web browser anywhere on the Internet. They can access all their email
                     as if they were using Mac OS X Mail or another mail application on their computers.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">Besides these web services, you can also publish custom websites that you have created (or someone has created for you) using
                     website development software. You can restrict access to each website to a particular group, or restrict parts of the website
                     to particular groups. You can also specify each website’s IP address, an access port, and the folder where website files are
                     stored on the server. A custom website is also called a virtual host.
