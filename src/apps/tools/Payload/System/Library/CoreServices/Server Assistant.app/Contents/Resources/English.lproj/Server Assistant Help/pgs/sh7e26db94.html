                  <p class="Para">Use the Network pane to specify connection settings for your server’s network interfaces. The group of settings for each interface
                     is a network connection service. A network interface is also called a port, which is the part of the interface that a plug
                     or cable connects to.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">Your server needs a network connection service for the local network that users’ computers connect to. This is usually an
                     Ethernet network, but may be an AirPort network. If your Internet service provider (ISP) requires connecting via PPPoE, you
                     need to configure a PPPoE network service connection. If your server connects to more than one network, you need to configure
                     a network connection service for each network your server connects to.

                        <p class="Para">The first active network connection service is the server’s primary network connection. The server uses this service for all

               <div class="Outro">
                  <p class="Para">The Network pane initially lists a network connection service for each of the server’s Ethernet interfaces. Other available
                     network interfaces aren’t listed, because Ethernet is preferred for server network connections. To see all network interfaces,
                     use the Action (gear) button. If the server has no Ethernet interfaces, the Network pane lists all available network interfaces.
                     The Network pane doesn’t initially list any services if you’re creating a profile for later automatic server setup.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">Most Macintosh computers have a built-in Ethernet port. They may have additional interfaces built in or added on, such as
                     an AirPort interface for a wireless network connection, a FireWire port that can be used for a network connection, or a second
                     Ethernet port.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">Intel-based Xserve systems also have an interface for the lights-out management (LOM) processor. This interface has its own
                     IP address and lets you connect to the server using the Server Monitor application even when the server is shut down.

                     <p class="Para">If the Internet Gateway pane appeared prior to the Network pane, and you chose to make this server an Internet gateway, you
                        can’t change settings for the Ethernet connection to your local network. Server Assistant configures those settings automatically.

                     <p class="Para">If you’re setting up multiple servers at the same time, Server Assistant displays the Network pane for each one in turn. The
                        text near the top of the pane tells you the DNS name and IP address of the server you’re currently configuring.

                     <p class="Para">If you’re creating a profile for later automatic server setup, the network connection services you configure in this pane
                        will be used as follows: While setting up a server automatically, Server Assistant tries to match a network connection service
                        in the saved profile to the server’s network interfaces by comparing hardware addresses (also called MAC addresses or Ethernet
                        IDs). If that fails, it tries to match the interface name (also called the BSD port name) of a saved network connection service,
                        such as en0, en1, or fw0, to the server’s network interfaces. If that fails, it doesn’t use the saved network connection service.
                     </p>
                     <p class="Para">You can set up generic network connection services that will match the network interfaces on a variety of servers. Set up
                        two Ethernet services and one AirPort service, and set the Configure IPv4 option of each to Using DHCP. Before starting automatic
                        server setup, make sure your DHCP service is configured to assign a fixed (static) IP address to each network interface of
                        each server being set up automatically. If a particular server doesn’t have two Ethernet interfaces or an AirPort interface,
                        Server Assistant doesn’t use the corresponding saved network connection service.
