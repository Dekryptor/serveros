                  <p class="Para">This computer has the Mac OS X Server software installed, and Server Assistant is ready to lead you through the initial setup
                     process to get the server up and running. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">If the computer has a new installation of Mac OS X Server, you can set it up interactively or begin automatic setup with a
                     saved setup profile.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">If you upgraded the computer from an earlier version of Mac OS X Server, you need only enter a serial number for Mac OS X
                     version 10.6 Snow Leopard. All other server settings remain unchanged. Server Assistant performs any migration of system data
                     required by upgraded services.

                        <p class="Para">Select the region whose time, date, and number formats you want the server to use, and then click Continue.</p>
                        <p class="Para">By default, only regions for the language selected during installation are shown. If you don’t see the region you want, select
                           Show All.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Para">The regional formats affect Finder windows and applications on the server. After setup, you can change the region in the International
                           pane of System Preferences.
                        </p>

                     <div class="ListSingle">
                        <p class="Para">If you want to use an auto server setup profile that you created earlier and saved on a removable drive or disc, connect the
                           drive to the server or insert the disc in the server now.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Para">Server Assistant looks for a profile in a folder named Auto Server Setup at the top (root) level of all available disks. If
                           the profile has restricting conditions, Server Assistant will use it if the server satisfies any of the conditions. If Server
                           Assistant finds multiple profiles whose conditions the server satisfies, it uses the profile that most specifically matches.
                           For more information about these conditions, see <a href="sh7e2e7c28.html">Saving an Auto Setup Profile</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Para">For more information about automatic server setup, see the <span class="Emphasis">Installation &amp; Setup Worksheet. </span>(It’s in the Documentation folder on the <span class="Emphasis">Mac OS X Server Install Disc</span>.)

               <div class="Outro">
                  <p class="Para">After completing interactive or automatic server setup, you may need to perform additional setup tasks. Look for the Mac OS X
                     Server Next Steps document that’s generated and placed on the server’s desktop after setup, and read it for specific advice.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">Before using the server, you may also want to set up additional services, change some service settings, or manage users and
                     groups. You can use Server Preferences, Server Admin, Workgroup Manager, and other applications in the /Applications/Server/
                     folder. You can also use UNIX command-line tools. For more information about the server applications and tools, see the <span class="Emphasis">Getting Started</span> manual included with Mac OS X Server.
