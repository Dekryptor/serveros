                     linking your local network to the Internet.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">The Gateway pane appears only if the server has two Ethernet ports configured as follows:</p>

                     <li>
                        <p class="Para">One Ethernet port must have a public IP address on the Internet (not a private IP address like 10.0.0.1 or 192.168.1.1). This
                           port is connected to your DSL modem, cable modem, or other Internet source. Usually, you use the server’s first built-in Ethernet
                           port for this.
                        </p>

                           Ethernet port must be unconfigured, have a manual IP address, or have a self-assigned IP address beginning with 169.254. Other
                           computers connected to this local network will share the server’s Internet connection.

                           network. DHCP service assigns these addresses to computers whose Ethernet ports are configured with the “Using DHCP” option.

                        <p class="Para">You can also give users addresses 192.168.1.2 through 192.168.1.99, to use to configure their Ethernet ports with the “Using
                           DCHP with manual address” option. Addresses 192.168.1.200 through 192.168.1.220 are reserved for your server’s VPN service.

                        <p class="Para">Sets up the server’s firewall to block incoming connections that originate from computers on the Internet. The firewall allows
                           outgoing connections from computers on the local network. It also allows incoming connections that are responding to the local
                           computers’ outgoing connections. After setup, you can use the Security pane of Server Preferences to allow incoming requests
                           through the firewall for specific services.
