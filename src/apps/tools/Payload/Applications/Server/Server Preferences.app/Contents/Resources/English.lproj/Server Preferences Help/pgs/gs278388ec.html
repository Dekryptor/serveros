                  <p class="Para">If you have a new server or a computer with Mac OS X Server newly installed, you can set it up over the network by using Server
                     Admin and Server Assistant on an administrator computer. The server you’re setting up doesn’t need a display. For information
                     about administrator computers, see <a href="gs3a8dc1e8.html">Preparing an Administrator Computer</a>. For information about setting up multiple servers remotely, open Server Admin and then use the Help menu.

                                 (fixed) so users’ computers can access the server via the Internet, for example to use the server’s VPN service.

                           type it. For an Intel-based Xserve that has had its main logic board replaced and has no hardware serial number, enter “System
