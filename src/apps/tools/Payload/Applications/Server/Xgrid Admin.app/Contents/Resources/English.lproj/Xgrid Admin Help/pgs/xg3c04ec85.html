                  <p class="Para">Systems that are under common administration in a company, university computer lab, or other managed environment can often
                     be easily assembled into a grid for desktop recovery. These systems are often on a local area network (LAN) and they are generally
                     managed by a single organization. As a result, they provide good network performance and offer substantial manageability.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">Because these systems are often also used as day-to-day workstations, users can easily interrupt grid tasks by moving the
                     mouse, resetting the system, or even accidentally disconnecting the system from the network. In such cases, a task might fail
                     as part of an Xgrid job. The Xgrid controller eventually reassigns the failed task to another agent, and the job completes
                     successfully.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Para">In local grids, performance is limited by such situations and by the varying performance of any given agent on the grid.</p>
