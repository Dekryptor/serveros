            <div class="AppleTopicBody">
               <div class="Intro">
                  <p class="Para">The broadcast method you choose depends on the size of your expected audience:</p>
                  <ul class="ListBullet">
                     <li>
                        <p class="Para">When broadcasting a live event to only one viewer, you can use QuickTime Broadcaster on Mac OS X; you don’t need server software.
                           Sending a broadcast to one recipient is called unicasting. Unicasting is the most common delivery method for general Internet
                           broadcasting.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Para">The unicast recipient must have a computer with QuickTime Player, QuickTime Streaming Server (QTSS), or Darwin Streaming Server
                           installed. If the recipient has server software, the server can reflect your broadcast to multiple viewers.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p class="Para">For an audience of a few hundred connected users, a single Mac computer can run both QuickTime Broadcaster and QTSS. QuickTime
                           Broadcaster sends the stream to QTSS, which then delivers the stream to a group of clients.
                        </p>
                        <p class="Para">The number of clients that can connect to the broadcast depends on available bandwidth and processor capacity. A typical Mac
                           Pro configuration supports at least 200 DSL connections or 400 dial-up connections. This configuration works well for online
                           classes, lectures, and other events with a limited audience.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p class="Para">If your broadcast is to be viewed by a large number of people, use two computers, one with QuickTime Broadcaster to broadcast
                           the stream, and the other with QTSS to reflect the stream to multiple viewers.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p class="Para">If you are on a multicast-enabled network, you can reach multiple viewers by multicasting your broadcast. Multicasting is
                           a method of broadcasting over a local network (not over the Internet) using a single stream that’s shared among all viewers
                           of the broadcast. Each viewer tunes in to the broadcast much like a radio tunes into an FM broadcast.
                        </p>
