# Xserve Reloaded

**Xserve Reloaded** – The Xserve was the Apple server until November 5, 2010 that
was officially discontinued, offering as an alternative the Mac Mini Server or the
Mac Pro, but none of these machines are designed with server-grade hardware in
mind and are not a real replacement.

The latest model of the Xserve received software updates up to OS X El Capitan, however
from Mac OS X Lion the Xserve received the same OS used on the other Macs, a more
user-oriented operating system rather than a server-oriented operating system, eliminating
all the server tools and replacing them with the weak "Server.app" application.

Xserve Reloaded, seeks to give a new life to the Xserve giving the possibility of
installing the latest versions of macOS and bringing back part of the server-oriented
functionality lost in previous versions.
